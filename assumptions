Directional selection
The phenotype is normally distributed in the parent generation ~ N(M, V)
proportion P of individuals is selected to contribute to the next generation
based on phenotypic values
Random Mating
Infinitesimal Model: infinite number of loci
Environmental deviation is normally distributed
Envrionmental variance is constant
No epistatsis effects.
no physical linkage disequilibrium between loci


The genetic variance is composed of equilibrium and disequilibrium contribution
equilibrium genetic variance is the genetic variance at H-W equilibrium
without physical linkage, the disequilibrium contribution without selection would be 0.

Selection would introduce a negative correlation between pairs of loci, and the actual genetic variance will be less than the equilibrium
genetic variance.

1/2 of the disequilibrium contribution will be retained in the next generation without selection.
And the disequilibrium contribution introduced by selection is from heretibility, and change in the variance of the selected parental group.
which in normal distribution, is dV = -I(I-x)V. 

# Analyses: how to maximize end response to selection.
R* = h2 * I * np.sqrt(V)

only depends on d*,

d* is always negative,
