recombination reduces linkage disequilibrium, length of LD blocks
distance 

basic LD random based on sample size = no actual LD

r2 prediction

new mutation: linked with chr it occurs on, until recombination

population structure: isolated, linkage -> admixture 

Walhund effect: pooling subpopulations

inversion reduces recombination

inbreeding/self fertalization -> increase homozygosity, decrease recombination that create differences
make long blocks presist

natrual selection of loci combinations (epistasis)
functional LD, kill the recombinations

canadate gene

no polymorphism: can't do calculations

predict time by LD
